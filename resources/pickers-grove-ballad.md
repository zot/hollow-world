Pickup at Picker's Grove

In canyons deep, where shadows creep,  
Two young men rode, their souls asleep.  
Young Ebb and Zeke, on a journey grand,  
To Picker's Grove, across the western land.  
Through autumn woods, the path they trod,  
Then came the rain, a vengeful god.  
The wagon stuck, the mud so deep,  
Promises made they had to keep.  
Within a cave, they sought their rest,  
The fire low, put to the test.  
At midnight's hour, a chilling sight,  
Zeke awoke in the pale moonlight.  
A pulsing mass, a toad-like head,  
Upon Ebb's neck, the living dead.  
With burning torch, he fought the bane,  
A burst of sparks, then naught remained.  
Those memories dark, not his alone,  
Of Cerro Gordo, and seeds unsown.  
The price of Dust, a chilling truth,  
A haunting echo of a stolen youth.  
They rebuilt the fire, the night so long,  
Their secret shared, a silent song.  
Of leeches giant, a common dream,  
A world transformed, beyond what seemed.  
Now back in the light, their journey done,  
A tale unspoken, beneath the sun.  
For in that cave, where shadows fell,  
They learned a truth, no tongue could tell.
