PHASE 1 - BRAINSTORMING (Parallel):
Launch both agents simultaneously for quick initial analysis:

Agent 1 (spec-writer): Create a brief outline covering:
- Key features/components (bullet points only)
- High-level architecture sketch
- Major user flows
- Open questions
Keep this under 300 words - DO NOT write full specification yet.

Agent 2 (spec-implementer): From an implementation perspective, identify:
- Technical risks or blockers
- Architectural concerns
- Integration points with existing code
- Testing challenges
Keep this under 300 words - focus on critical concerns only.

After both agents complete, synthesize their brainstorming feedback.

PHASE 2 - DETAILED SPECIFICATION:
Use the spec-writer agent to create comprehensive specifications incorporating the brainstorming insights.

PHASE 3 - IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW:
Have the spec-implementer agent review the full specifications for completeness and implementability and provide feedback on:
- Missing implementation details
- Ambiguities that would block development
- Technical feasibility concerns
- Test coverage requirements
- Any gaps in the specifications

The spec-writer should iterate based on final feedback.
