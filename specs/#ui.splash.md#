- display the version number at the bottom of the splash screen
- print the current version number to the console

### As soon as app loads

## 🧭 History Management

### URL-Based Navigation

- **Each view** gets its own URL path

### Browser History Integration
- **History array of objects** for browser back/forward navigation

  - **New navigation**: Can navigate to different object
    - **Future deletion**: Removes "future" history objects
    - **New object**: Pushes new object to history array
