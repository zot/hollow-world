# 🤠 Character Management Specification
## *"Don't Go Hollow, Partner"*

**🏜️ Frontier Character Wrangling System for the Hollow World Webapp 🏜️**

*Saddle up your characters for the wild frontier adventure*

---

🌵 *Based on [`../claude.md`](../claude.md)* 🌵

---

## 🎯 Core Requirements *(Code Harder Than a Two-Dollar Steak)*
- Use **SOLID principles** in all implementations *(Keep it cleaner than a Sunday church service)*
- Create comprehensive **unit tests** for all components *(Test everything twice, trust nothing once)*
- Use **HTML templates** instead of JavaScript template literals *(Separate your concerns like a good sheriff)*

### Character structure
- total XP and total Attribute Chips are based on rank
- available Attribute Chips is computed dynamically
  - rank's attribute chip total - current attribute cost total
    - this amount is allowed to go higher than the rank's attribute ship total
    - make sure there's a test for Dex -2 and all other attrs at 0
      - the attribute chip total should be 8 higher than the rank's attribute chip total
  - doesn't drop below 0 because extra attribute points come from XP
- available XP is computed dynamically from skills and total attribute costs that exceed total attribute chips

### 🧭 Navigation *(Trail Blazing Through the UI)*
- **Browser back button** navigates to previous screen *(Like ridin' back to where you came from)*
- **Persistent character list** tracked across sessions *(Your posse remembers you)*

### 📜 Character List Display *(The Saloon Roll Call)*
- **"Add Character" button** at the bottom *(Recruit new gunhands for your outfit)*
- **UUID-based storage** for each character *(Every outlaw needs a proper wanted poster)*
- **Character card list entries** showing *(Like a deck of playing cards, but deadlier)*:
  - Character name, rank, xp, dc, dust *(The vital statistics)*
    - *The 4 stats should be bottom aligned in the row like bullets in a chamber*
  - Physical attrs *(How tough they are)*
  - Social attrs *(How smooth they talk)*
  - Mental attrs *(How sharp they think)*
  - **Delete button** on the right (💀 skull and crossbones) *(Send 'em to Boot Hill)*

### 🖱️ Interaction *(How to Wrangle Your Characters)*
- **Click character item** to edit *(Pick your fighter)*
  - Navigates to character editor view *(Head to the character creation station)*
  - Passes UUID in URL path *(Proper paperwork for the sheriff)*

### 🏗️ Editor Initialization *(Setting Up Camp)*
- **From character manager**: Load character from storage using UUID in URL path *(Find your outlaw in the filing cabinet)*
- **From browser navigation**: Edit history item live as "current" character *(Pick up where you left off)*
- **Live editing**: Make changes without persistence until "Yep" button clicked *(Sketch in the dirt before carving in stone)*

### 🎨 Editor Interface *(The Character Creation Saloon)*
- **🎭 Stylish old-timey labeled fields** for editing character values *(Fancy as a gambling hall)*
- **📋 Character sheet integration** with full Hollow RPG system *(All the rules, none of the confusion)*
- **🤠 Western styling** consistent with splash screen theme *(Prettier than a painted lady)*
- **📊 Resource displays** - Show unspent XP and attribute chips for current rank *(Keep track of your gold and gunpowder)*
- **🏷️ Attribute organization** - Arrange attributes in rows by cost order (4, 3, 1) *(Most expensive to cheapest, like whiskey pricing)*:
  - 💪 **Physical** - DEX(4), STR(3), CON(1) *(How fast, strong, and tough you are)*
  - 🗣️ **Social** - CHA(4), WIS(3), GRI(1) *(How charming, wise, and gritty you are)*
  - 🧠 **Mental** - INT(4), PER(4) *(How smart and sharp-eyed you are)*
  - *A little space between the attr and the open paren* *(Give 'em breathing room)*
  - *A little space between the close paren and the attribute value* *(Don't crowd the numbers)*
  - a 1145px wide character sheet editor should show 3 attributes across in the Attributes section
    - 5px column gap between attributes
    - 5px left/right padding on the attributes container
- **🎨 Attribute value spacing** - Add visual spacing before each attribute input value for better readability *(Make it easy on the eyes)*
- **🖱️ Mouse wheel interaction** - Attribute input spinners respond to mouse wheel for increment/decrement with range validation (-2 to 15) *(Scroll like you're spinning the cylinder of a six-shooter)*
- **📈 Top stats bar** - Rank, damage capacity, dust, available XP, and Attribute Chips at top under character name *(The important stuff front and center)*
- **🎯 Available XP display** *(Your advancement currency)*:
  - Show total XP in parentheses in label based on rank (rank 1 = 10 XP, +10 per additional rank) *(Show the pot size)*
  - Value shown is unspent XP remaining *(What you got left to spend)*
- **🎲 Available Attribute Chips display** *(Your character creation tokens)*:
  - Show total chips in parentheses in label based on rank (rank 1 = 16 chips, +1 per additional rank) *(Show your stake)*
  - Available attribute chips should be total chips - the total attribute costs *(What's left after you ante up)*
    - Show negatives as 0 because the excess points are automatically removed from XP anyway *(Don't go into debt, partner)*
    - This should update whenever attributes change *(Live as a poker game)*
  - make sure that XP shows in red whenever available XP is negative
- available xp and attribute chips should have their proper appearance when first showing the editor
- **⚡ Editable rank input** *(Promote your gunslinger)*:
  - Number input field with min/max validation (1-15) *(From greenhorn to legend)*
  - On blur: automatically updates total XP and Attribute Chips available, also the totals in parens *(Recalculate the pot)*

### 🌟 New Characters *(Fresh Meat for the Frontier)*
- New characters start with points given in game rules (XP and Attribute Chips) *(Everyone gets a fair shake)*

### 🔘 Action Buttons *(The Business End of Character Creation)*

#### ➕ **Attribute Spinner Button** *(Fine-Tuning Your Gunslinger)*
- **🎨 Stylish western-themed** spinner buttons on each attribute *(Classier than a silver-plated Colt)*
  - Stacked arrows, like normal spinner buttons but still western themed *(Up and down like a bucking bronco)*
  - No space between the value and the spinner buttons *(Tight as a new saddle)*
- **⬆️ When incrementing** an attribute *(Making your outlaw meaner)*:
  - **🎲 Priority spending**: Take points from Attribute Chips first, then XP when chips depleted *(Spend your coins before your gold)*
  - **⚡ Live validation**: Prevent increment if insufficient resources *(Can't buy what you can't afford)*
  - Don't allow increment unless both of these apply *(Even legends have limits)*:
    - **📏 The new value is in range** *(Stay between the fences)*
    - **💰 There's enough XP and Attribute Chips to pay for the new value** *(Don't write checks your wallet can't cash)*
  - **📊 Update displayed available XP and available Attribute Chips** *(Keep the books current)*

#### ➖ **Attribute Decrement Logic** *(Getting Your Money Back)*
- **📊 Point restoration** = attribute cost (1, 3, or 4 points) *(Get back what you paid)*
- **📈 Current total** = sum of all attribute costs before decrement *(Count your chips before cashing out)*
- **📉 Next total** = sum of all attribute costs after decrement *(What you'll have left)*
- **🚫 Range protection**: Don't allow decrement if attribute would be out of range *(Don't ride off a cliff)*
- **📊 Update displays**: Update available XP and Attribute Chips after a decrement *(Balance the books)*

#### 🚫 **"Nope" Button** *(The Chicken-Out Option)*
- **Revert changes**: Reload character from storage *(Put everything back the way it was)*
- **Update fields**: Display original stats in all fields *(Wipe the slate clean)*
- **History update**: Overwrite history item with retrieved object *(Fix the paperwork)*
- Enable only if there are changes to revert *(No point in backing down if you ain't moved forward)*
- test cases for these things

#### ✅ **"Yep" Button** *(Seal the Deal)*
- Enable only if there are changes that have not been saved *(Only when you got something worth keeping)*
- **Save workflow** *(The proper way to file your paperwork)*:
  1. Load original character from storage → temporary variable *(Keep a backup copy)*
  2. Save current (edited) character to storage *(Write it in permanent ink)*
  3. Replace history object with original from temporary variable *(Clean up the records)*
  4. Remove any "future" history items *(No fortune telling allowed)*
  5. Add newly saved character to history *(Add it to the ledger)*
  6. Advance internal history for proper back button behavior *(Keep the timeline straight)*
- test cases for these things

### 🧭 Navigation Behavior *(Finding Your Way Around the Frontier)*
- **Browser back button** returns to previous history object *(Backtrack your steps)*
- **History management** ensures proper state restoration *(Remember where you've been)*
- **Future truncation** when new changes are made *(Can't change the past, but you can change the future)*
