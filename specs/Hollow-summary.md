# Characters

Characters have a name, a description, a Rank, Attributes, Skills, Benefits, Drawbacks, and equipment. You use experience points (XP) to buy Skills and, optionally, Temps, Items, and Companions for your character. Attribute Chips and XP Chips make character creation and Ranking simple.

**Physical Attributes**  
**Dex (Dexterity)** ‚Äì coordination, manual dexterity, how quick you are  
**Str (Strength)** ‚Äì how strong and large you are  
**Con (Constitution)** ‚Äì resistance to disease, endurance, stamina, hardiness, health, and how well you heal  
**Social Attributes**  
**Cha (Charisma)** ‚Äì How quick-witted you are and how well you can turn aside social attacks  
**Wis (Wisdom)** ‚Äì willpower, courage, judgment, social insight, empathy  
**Gri (Grit)** ‚Äì how well you withstand psychological damage, recover from Afflictions  
**Mental Attributes**  
**Int (Intelligence)** ‚Äì mental insight, reasoning, analysis, problem solving, design and understanding of complex things  
**Per (Perception)** ‚Äì memory, focus, how well you habitually pay attention to your surroundings, and how acute your senses are

* **Rank:** starts at 1\. Every full 10XP you earn increases your Rank by 1\.  
* **Skills (listed Skills are marked with üûê, and ‚óá):** individual areas of expertise,  
* **Damage Capacity:** 10 \+ CON (Health)  
* **Fields (marked with** üõÜ**):** broad areas of expertise, each with up to 6 Skills,  
* **Benefits and Drawbacks:** permanent Influences that apply based on your situation,  
* **Dust:** how many Grains of Glimmer Dust you have; you can use Glimmer Dust to influence events and to manipulate the Glimmer.  
* **Burned:** how many Grains of Dust you have burned.  
* **Hollow** is how Hollow you are (see [Hollowing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1#heading=h.dy6kpgf2cccc))  
* **Items:** extraordinary objects like fine weapons and advanced items;  
* **Companions (marked with üûÜ):** animals and other people which you play along with your PC.

Beginning characters start with 16 Attribute Chips, one Benefit, one Drawback, 10 Grains of Dust, and 10XP ‚Äì all of your Attributes can range from \-2 to 15\. During character creation, you can increase your available XP by taking additional Drawbacks and you can shift your Attribute points around or spend XP to increase them but **your final total Attribute Levels must be at least 2**. See [Creating a Character](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.stxfbg5ukzbv).

# **Round Up**

Sometimes you might have to divide a Level or a Result by a number. Always round up unless the text says otherwise.

# **Character Rank: One Rank Every Full 10XP**

For every full 10XP, you have 1 Character Rank. This is called ‚ÄúRank‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúLevel‚Äù to prevent confusion because so many things in this game have Levels.

Characters generally start at Rank 1 with 10XP plus 2 Attribute Levels.

# **Attributes (x1, x3, or x4)**

Attributes cost 1XP/Level, 3XP/Level, or 4XP/Level. 

## **Attributes (everyone has these)**

Attributes do not require training; everyone has them already. There are 8 Attributes: Dex (Dexterity), Str (Strength), Con (Constitution), Cha (Charisma), Wis (Wisdom), Gri (Grit), Int (Intelligence), Per (Perception). Attributes can operate passively using Hidden Influence.

There are three Attribute categories: Physical, Mental, and Social. Each has one Attribute that generally adds to Influence and one Attribute that generally adds to Result Bonus. The Physical and Social categories also have Attributes that affect healing and Damage.

Attributes marked x4 cost 4XP/Level, x3 cost 3XP/Level, and x1 cost 1XP/Level.

### **Physical**

### **Dex (Dexterity, x4):** coordination, manual dexterity, how quick you are.

* If you fall, a successful Dex roll absorbs its Success in Damage.  
* Perform feats of agility, such as jumping over obstacles while running, dodging thrown objects, jumping over a pit, climbing a wall or a rope, and so on.  
* Helps Initiative rolls during conflicts.

* Ask the GM for information you didn‚Äôt write down,  
* Helps Initiative rolls during conflicts.

# **Skills (x1 or x2)**

| Expertise at different Skill Levels Skill Level Expertise 1-2 Apprentice 3-4 Journeyman 5-6 Master 7+ Grandmaster  |
| ----- |

Skills represent your training, knowledge, expertise, and even sometimes equipment or mystical resources. Skills are really Influences with extra rules that apply when you perform certain Actions, like attacking someone or trying to gain access to a fort. Some Skills compensate for negative Influences, like [Second Weapon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.qch7qh2vyx7w), which mitigates Second Weapon \-4. These can reduce a negative Influence down to zero but, of course, not past zero ‚Äì Levels higher than the negative Influence generally contribute in some other way.

A Skill‚Äôs description gives a good indication how it works in the game but players make up many of the Skills in the game. Whether a made up Skill works for an Action depends on how the player and GM interpret its name, so made up Skill names are important and there are rules for them. See [Created Skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.3aqoilhqv071).

The listed Skills are marked with **üûê** to distinguish them from Skills you make up. Skills cost 1XP/Level unless they are marked **x2**, which cost 2XP/Level.

Unless the description says otherwise, in order to raise a Skill higher than Level 1, it must be in a Field (see [Fields](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1#heading=h.z8hoig3vk6rh) and the individual Skill descriptions). If a Skill is in a Field you generally spend XP on the Field rather than on individual Skills but you can still spend XP on a Skill to raise it one Level higher than the Field ‚Äì put a checkmark next to the Skill to represent this specialization.

Trying an action for which you have no Skill at all generally suffers Untrained \-4, or sometimes might not be possible at all (like a wild wolf setting the time on a clock).

Some Skills have prerequisites. Prerequisites must have at least the same level as the Skill, so in order to have Finesse (Broom) 3, you have to have Broom 3\. To have Martial Arts 3 you must have at least Dex 3 or both Str 3 and Con 3\.

Some Skills are Specialized and have a term in parentheses after their name, like ‚Äú(Style)‚Äù. If it says ‚Äú(Skill)‚Äù, that means it must be based on another Skill that you have. When you take a Skill like this, you replace the parenthesized word on your sheet with your choice. ‚ÄúFinesse (Skill)‚Äù means when you pick Finesse, you specify which Skill you have Finesse in. ‚ÄúRhetoric (Style)‚Äù means when you pick Rhetoric, you choose your style of rhetoric, either from the list of examples or by making one up. You can take this kind of Skill more than once if you choose different terms to fill in. In a Field, different specializations count as different Skills.

	***Skills***

| üûê Brawling (x2) üûê Charm üûê Counsellor (x2) ‚óá Dust üûê Fine Weapon (x2) üûê Finesse (x2, Skill) üûê Martial Arts (x2, Dex or Str & Con) | üûê Mechanic üûê Medic (x2) üûê Mesmerism üûê Mobile Weapon (Weapon Skill) üûê Oratory (x2) üûê Quickdraw (Weapon Skill) | üûê Rhetoric (x2, Style) üûê Second Weapon (x2, Weapon Skill) üûê Tactics (x2) üûê Weapon (x2, Type) üûê Weapon Expertise (Weapon Skill) üûê Wrestling (x2) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

## **üûê Brawling (x2):** Add Level to fist and kick for Nonlethal Damage (see [Strength-Based Weapons And Fine Weapons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.kflejhr63l60#heading=h.kwnasvh4tljw)). 

* You can use blackjacks and improvised weapons for Nonlethal Damage.  
* Reduce Unarmed \-4 by ¬Ω your Level against armed opponents; if you fail, reduce failure Damage by ¬Ω your Level.  
* Reduce Stood on One Leg by your Level when you kick.

Brawling counts as a weapon Skill with such Skills as Second Weapon and Weapon Expertise.

## **üûê Charm:** Reduce negative Influences for Social Actions by your Skill Level. Operates in addition to the Action‚Äôs main Skill.

## **üûê Counsellor (x2):** You have a knack for helping people work through their psychological and mental problems. Like Medic but for Social Afflictions ‚Äì see Medic.

## **üûê Fine Weapon (x2):** You can use XP to purchase fine weapons, which add their Level (up to 3\) either to your Influence or to base Damage (you choose whenever you use it). This should not go into a Field because you can raise it past Level 1 outside of a Field and it cannot go higher than Level 3\. If you do put it in a field, the Field will be limited to 3 Levels and you will need to create another Field without the weapon for any successive Levels.

## **üûê Finesse (x2, Skill):** **Requires Skill at the same Level or higher.** Add your Finesse Level as a Result Bonus when you Create an Influence with the chosen Skill but suffer Difficult \-4 on your Action, reduced by your Finesse Level. If you are able to remove Difficult entirely, any leftover points add Influence to your roll, i.e. each Level above 4 adds 1 Influence to your roll.

*If you have a favorite option, it‚Äôs worthwhile writing it on your sheet to avoid bookkeeping later.*

## **üûê Martial Arts (x2, Dex or Str & Con):**

**Requires either Dex or both Str and Con at the same Level or higher.**  
Advanced training in fighting unarmed against armed and unarmed opponents and also Clinch Fighting and also with close combat weapons such as knives, short batons or clubs, garrotes, pegs, belaying pins, and improvised weapons. People trained with Martial Arts can *choose whether to do lethal or Nonlethal Damage* while unarmed.

Martial Arts counts as a weapon Skill with such Skills as Second Weapon and Weapon Expertise.

Native Americans have access to these techniques but Westerners generally only have access to Brawling or Wrestling. If you have a trainer, however, you can learn fighting systems of indigenous peoples, other lands, or even ancient esoteric orders.

Martial Arts confers many advantages but requires extreme dedication to physical fitness, represented by its Attribute prerequisites. The prerequisite cost of 4 per Level makes this the most expensive path of expertise. Because of this, masters of Martial Arts are very rare.

With Martial Arts Training:

* Adds Level to Str for fist and kick Damage  
* Adds Level to Con when shrugging off Damage  
* You can use short close combat weapons like knives, short batons or clubs, garrotes, pegs, and belaying pins  
* You can use improvised weapons (frying pans, etc. generally do \-1 Damage)  
* Choose Lethal or Nonlethal Damage with fists and kicks (pointed boots always do lethal Damage)  
* Use Clinch Fighting techniques that require training  
* Ignore Stood on One Leg \-4 when kicking  
* Reduce Prone \-4 by your Level when attacking and defending while prone against standing opponents while unarmed or close combat weapons  
* Reduce Unarmed \-4 against Melee Attacks by Level and if you fail, reduce failure Damage by Level.

## **üûê Mechanic:** detect, identify, and create mechanical devices, including traps, which you can also arm and disarm, generally using Dex or Per, depending on the task.

## **üûê Medic (x2):** You can tend to someone‚Äôs wounds and manage illnesses, generally using Int \+ Medic for the Influence and Per for the Result Bonus. Tending wounds successfully soon after a character receives them **heals Success in Damage** and also aids the healing process. Cannot be used untrained.

## **üûê Mesmerism:** As Charm but twice as effective and very useful for unreasonable Persuasion, finding out sensitive information, and creating lasting Impressions or Motivations. If you fail an action using this, it becomes ***Unfriendly*** (see Lasting Impressions and Reputations). Can create a temporary Motivation on another person and sometimes even a permanent one.

## **üûê Mobile Weapon (Weapon Skill):** mitigates Moving \-6, which you get from using a weapon while moving. Any Levels above 4 add to Skill when you use a weapon while moving.

## **üûê Oratory:** You have training or experience influencing crowds with Significant Remarks. During a Conflict, you can make Significant Remarks that affect your Zone; your Skill Level reduces the negative Audience Influence.

## **üûê Quickdraw (Weapon Skill):** mitigates Quickdraw \-4 when you draw a weapon and use it with Skill on the same turn. Any Levels above 4 add to Skill when you quickdraw.

## **üûê Rhetoric (x2, style):** **Requires the same Level or higher in either Charm or Mesmerism and Wis.** Formal training in debate and argumentation, or extensive experience with it. Choose the style in which you socially engage: Gentry, Soldier, Scholar, Lawyer, Detective, Cowboy, Salt of the Earth, and so on. This Skill applies to Social Actions and defense against them. In Social Conflicts you have certain advantages and people without Rhetoric suffer Unarmed \-4 against you.

## **üûê Second Weapon (x2, Weapon Skill):** Reduces Second Weapon \-4 by your Skill Level (but not past zero). Also, *Second Weapon \-4 does not affect your first Attack at all*. The second weapon you attack with must use the chosen weapon Skill. Any Levels above 4 add Influence to both Attacks.

## **üûê Tactics (x2):** judge opponents‚Äô intentions and use tactical techniques. You can use this for initiative rolls, to give advice, and even to steal initiative. When used during combat, Tactics rolls generally use either Cha, Per.

On each round where an opponent goes first, if you succeed in a Tactics roll against their best tactician (they have Untrained \-4 if there are none) your side gets initiative instead.

On any round where you go first (even after stealing initiative), you can use your action to advise your allies who can hear you: make a Tactics roll with Difficult \-4 to Create a positive Influence on all of them for the round.

## **üûê Weapon (x2, Type):** skill with a type of weapon (guns, bows, blades, axes, and so on). This adds Influence to your Actions with the weapon.

## **üûê Weapon Expertise (Weapon Skill):** Reduce Reckless Attack \-6 by your Skill Level when you suffer them from using this weapon.

## **üûê Wrestling (x2):** Add Level to Str for Fist for Nonlethal Damage while Clinch fighting. Wrestling counts as a weapon Skill with such Skills as Second Weapon and Weapon Expertise.

## **‚óá Dust (50 Grains per XP):**  Dust does not represent training, it represents physical Glimmer Dust extracted from you by a Sinner Man. It is written with a diamond ‚óá because it‚Äôs a Glimmer Skill. It does not need to be in a Field to go higher than Level 1\.

## **Created Skills**

You create any other Skills you have besides the listed Skills. Skills can be professions, areas of study, weapon categories, and so on. These Skills add their Level to your dice rolls and potentially function in conflicts (either physical or social) and/or let you gather or use knowledge. If your new Skill needs to add or change rules, see [Nomic Skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1#heading=h.y0rhme69cpy6).

**Skills that interact with Conflicts, healing, and Knowledge Gathering are usually x2**. Professional Skills often have prerequisites (like literacy or mathematics at the same Level).

Normally you don‚Äôt even need a Skill description and interpreting the name will determine when the Skill operates. Because of this, the GM needs to approve your choice of name and you may need to work with them to make sure your Skill names aren‚Äôt too ‚Äústinky‚Äù‚Ä¶

### **Example Created Skills:**

|  Animal Handling Appraisal Art (media) Bluff Boating Craftsman (type) Cryptography Culture (type) Demolition Disguise Driving Escape Artist Etiquette Forgery Gambling Interrogation (x2) Intimidation Investigation (x2) Knots and ropes Knowledge (area) Language (type) Law (nation) Leadership (x2) Literacy Local Knowledge (x2, region) Locomotive Engineer Mathematics Mimicry (x2) Mining Mnemonics (x2) Mockery (x2) Mysteries Naturalist Navigation Negotiation (x2) Perform (type) Pick Locks Pick Pocket Profession (type) Rapport (x2) Riding River Pilot Sailing Scholar (type) Science (type) Search (x2) Sleight of Hand Stealth (x2) Steam Engineer Swimming Throwing (x2) Tracking Traps Truthsense (x2) Wilderness Survival  |
| :---- |

### **The Smell Test**

Here are some guidelines to help you choose a good name. Skill names that don‚Äôt have good answers to all of these questions are a bit (or maybe very) stinky.

* Is it limited in scope or really just a (cheaper) stand-in for an Attribute?  
* Is it clear what the Skill actually means or does?  
* Is the name too general or too specific ‚Äì should it be a Field?  
* When could the character use this Skill in a story?  
* When *couldn‚Äôt* the character use this Skill in a story?

Stinky Examples:

* These Skills should be Fields: warrior, doctor, circus performer, trapper  
* These Skills are really just Attributes: social operator, genius  
* These Skills are too general: good fortune, problem solving, winning smile

### New Nomic Skills

Nomic Skills create new rules or modify existing ones and all of the listed Skills are Nomic. These usually have a higher cost or prerequisites unless they‚Äôre not commonly used and/or provide benefits slowly (like Con which lets you absorb 1 point of damage every 5 Levels). As with any Skill you create, you need GM approval to make one. You can use the listed Skills as guidelines on making your own Nomic Skills.

### Skills that reduce negative influences

Skills like [Second Weapon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.qch7qh2vyx7w) and Charm that only serve to reduce negative Influences have the normal cost and operate along with an Action‚Äôs main Skill. Note that Second Weapon costs double because it removes the penalty on the first attack. Other specializations are possible, like Lasso Expertise, for instance, that might remove negative Influences while entangling someone else.

### Unfriendly Social Skills

As an exception, **if a created Skill is Social, mainly used in Social Actions, and also *unfriendly*, it has the normal cost, but has double influence**, because the problems an unfriendly Skill causes compensate for the double effect.

# **Fields**

A Field is a collection of Skills you create for your character to represent training in a profession or vocation. Fields act like Skills and use the same rules as Skills for names (see [Created Skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.3aqoilhqv071)). Outside of a Field, most Skills can only be Level 1 with the exception of Attributes and Skills that do not represent training, like Dust and Fine Weapon.

* You spend XP on a Field to raise all of its Skills at once.  
* Each Field must have at least 3 Skills.  
* You can raise any Skill by 1 Level by paying the XP and putting a checkmark next to it.  
* When you raise a FIeld‚Äôs Level, you can remove checkmarks to lower the cost.  
* You can list any Skill twice.  
* You can add Skills to Level 1 Fields, at Level 2, the Skill list is frozen 

# Benefits, Drawbacks and Resources

Benefits and Drawbacks are (mostly) permanent Influences on your character. You don‚Äôt buy them, you receive them at certain times during play: you receive one Benefit Level and one Drawback Level every 5th Rank and you can receive Drawback Levels as a result of grievous injuries.

## Benefits

A Benefit is a permanent positive Influence. Benefits are powerful but *do not operate all the time*, they are conditional, tied to a particular activity, situation, person (who is not always with you), organization, or place (but not the location of the current story ‚Äì see below) and may also be tied to a Skill (but the previous rule means they operate only under certain conditions). Here are some examples:

Lacklaw Organization Member \+2: only operates in the context of the ‚ÄúLacklaw Gang‚Äù,  
Master of the Flying Leap \+2: only operates during flying leaps,  
Heat Resistant \+2: only operates when resisting heat,  
Destroyer of Reptiles \+2: only operates when you are, well‚Ä¶ trying to destroy one or more reptiles.

If it‚Äôs not obvious what the conditions are for a Benefit, you should rephrase using ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù like

I‚Äôm Better When I‚Äôm Outnumbered \+2: only operates when you (or your group) is outnumbered,  
Very Persuasive When Being Threatened \+2: only operates when someone is threatening you.

## Drawbacks

Drawbacks are limited similarly to Benefits but a drawback must operate in *fairly common situations*. If it‚Äôs tied to a Skill, it should be a Skill you have, or at least part of one of your Fields. If it‚Äôs tied to an Attribute, it should affect certain uses of that Attribute; it should not be equivalent to lowering the Attribute all the time. Examples:

Illiterate \-2: can affect Social Actions and people‚Äôs perception of you  
Confused by Fast Talk \-2: affects Social Actions,  
Slow Thinker \-2: affects Mental Actions,  
Clumsy When Running \-2: affects physical Actions when running or charging,  
Not Very Convincing \-2: affects Request Actions,  
Easily Exhausted \-2: affects Con Actions,  
Intimidated by Authority Figures \-2: affects Actions against government officials, school teachers, etc.,  
Delicate Constitution \-2: affects Con Actions.

If it‚Äôs not obvious when a Drawback operates, rephrase it using ‚Äúby‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen,‚Äù like with Benefits.

# **Tools and Companions**

You are assumed to have the ordinary tools you are trained to use, unless circumstances specifically require otherwise like if they‚Äôve been confiscated, for instance. You can also put some of your XP into Tools and/or Companions. Tools you purchase with XP are extraordinary; they can be fine weapons, special devices, like a microscope or high-speed camera (these were around in the late 1800s)

## Companions

Companions are independent characters under your control. These can be animals or people. A trained animal is very affectionate towards you and you can command it according to its training (and the limitations of its intelligence).

### **Flying Creatures**

While in the air a flying creature can choose to use Flying or a weapon (if you have a weapon) for their Defensive Influence. Size affects flight, so creatures with Flying gain their Size Influence (good or bad) in Flying Levels. Note that *in addition to this effect, Size also applies to defending and dodging*, which means *Size counts twice for defending and dodging while flying*. Size is based on wingspan for most flying creatures.

# **Creating a Character**

Character creation uses XP Chips and positive and negative Attribute Chips.

* You start with  
  * 16 positive Attribute Chips,  
  * 10 XP Chips,  
  * 1 Benefit,  
  * 1 Drawback,  
  * 10 Grains of Dust.  
* You cannot buy any more Drawbacks until you Rank (see [Ranking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.pq14hc4t80yz)). 

## Attribute Assignment

During character creation, you buy Attributes with positive and negative Attribute Chips and, optionally, XP Chips. Attribute Chips come in 3 denominations: 4, 3, and 1:

* You must spend all of your Attribute Chips on Attributes.  
* You can spend XP Chips on Attributes and/or Skills and Benefits.  
* Attributes must range from \-2 to 15\.  
* You can take more positive Attribute Chips by also taking the same number of negative ones.  
* You can only spend Attribute Chips of the same type on an Attribute (positive and negative cancel out).  
* Stack Attribute Chips of the correct denomination in spaces representing your Attributes:

| Attribute Costs |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **4** | **3** | **1** |
| Dex | Str | Con |
| Cha | Wis | Gri |
| Int, Per |  |  |

## Starting Skills and Fields

In general, any Skill higher than Level 1 needs to be in a Field. The exceptions to this are Skills that don‚Äôt represent training or knowledge, like Dust and Fine Weapon.

Use your XP Chips to buy your Skills. Group any Skills higher than Level 1 into Fields (which you can name at the end). Fields:

* Must have at least 3 *different* Skills.  
* Can have any Skill twice.  
* Cost XP to increase by one Level equal to the XP costs of all of their Skills.  
* Have all Skills at the same Level as the Field or, potentially, one higher  
  * You can spend XP to raise any or all Skills one Level higher than the Field

## Buying Tools

Tools can be a finely made weapon or a ‚ÄúJules Verne science‚Äù gadget. A gadget contains one or more Fields, Benefits, and/or Drawbacks that add to yours. Tools don‚Äôt really offer any advantages, they‚Äôre just a way to package parts of your character in colorful ways.

*Note: Tools should make sense within the setting and there should be a rational explanation for how the Tool confers its abilities to the user. The GM can require changes.*

## Buying a Companion (min 5XP)

Companions are characters that act autonomously (under your control, not the GM‚Äôs) and they do not confer Skills to you like a Tool does. They can be people or trained animals:

* A Companion costs 5XP from your PC.  
* Companions start with 16 ***negative*** Attribute Chips (see [Attribute Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.38uzf3xl3p1o)).  
* The Companion can gain more Attribute Chips by taking the same number of negative Attribute Chips.  
* You can convert a Companion‚Äôs Attribute Chips into XP Chips.  
  * You can only spend these XP Chips on the Companion, **not on your PC**.  
* You can spend your PC‚Äôs XP Chips on your Companion.  
* A Companion can have up to one Drawback, gaining 1 XP from it.  
* Physical Attributes generally have a minimum of \-9 and other types have a minimum of \-6.  
* Str must be at least the minimum for the creature‚Äôs Size.  
* Natural advantages like claws or bite start out equivalent to a knife and can improve with Fine Weapon.  
* Animal combat skills are treated as Martial Arts, but the Attribute prerequisites are based on the averages for the animal, so Martial Arts 1 would require Dex or Str & Con at 1 Level higher than average, and so on.  
* Trained animals have rules for Int and S:  
  * Int \-6: understands simple commands and/or patterns with only one action.  
  * Int \-4: understands small, trained ‚Äúroutines‚Äù with up to 3 actions.  
  * Int \-2: can usually intuit what you want if it is relatively simple.  
  * Cha \-6..-5: acts only in its own interest unless directly commanded.  
  * Cha \-4..-3: considers you important but is not affectionate, will defend you.  
  * Cha \-2..-1: assists you if commanded or you are threatened.  
  * Cha \+0: actively attempts to assist you.

Write the XP you *spent* on the Companion, i.e. the total amount of your character‚Äôs XP you spent on it (which will be a minimum of 5XP). If you spend more XP on the Companion later, make sure to increase the amount on the sheet when you do. If the Companion dies, you regain that XP at the end of the next session or the end of the story, whichever comes first. You regain only the XP you spent, of course, and not any extra XP your Companion got from lowering Attributes or taking Drawbacks.

# **Gaining Experience and Sessions**

XP (experience) represents the results of training, practice, and real-world experience. When you gain XP, you don‚Äôt have to spend it immediately, but you can. Players generally have in mind how their PC is developing and role-play it before they gain XP. The recommended rate of XP is to gain 1 Rank per complete story, i.e. 10XP, with the GM giving out 1XP at the end of every play session, up to 8XP. The remainder is awarded at the end of the last session of the story. If the story takes more than 8 sessions, the GM can award 2 Grains at the end of each remaining session.

## Ranking Up

When you Rank Up (raise your Rank):

* Your Hollow limit increases by 1 (see [Hollowing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.dy6kpgf2cccc)).  
* You gain 5 Grains.  
* You gain 1 positive Attribute Chip.  
  * **Your Companions do not gain Attribute Chips**.  
* You can take up to 4 more positive Attribute Chips along with the same number of negative Attribute Chips.  
  * Companions can do likewise, spending their Chips on themselves, *not on your PC*.  
  * Companions must spend all of their Attribute Chips gained this way.  
* You can optionally take a Drawback Level to gain 1 XP Chip (strengthening a Drawback or making a new one).  
  * Your Companions can do likewise, spending the Chips on themselves, *not on your PC*.  
* You must spend all of your Attribute Chips (see [Attribute Assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.38uzf3xl3p1o) for costs).  
  * *For clarification: positive Attribute Chips increase Attribute Levels and negative ones decrease them.*  
  * PC Attributes range from \-2 to 15 (see [Buying a Companion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDDYVDtb2W0Mf37IL3p3roEfvgAcMO-HdzUEP9SSA_w/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.hhcxpj2u1qo7) for rules for Companions).  
* You do not have to spend all of your XP Chips.  
* Every 5th Rank (1st, 5th, 10th, ‚Ä¶) you get two Benefit Levels and two Drawback Levels. You will have 2 Levels of Benefit and Drawback at Rank 1, 4 Levels at Rank 5, 6 Levels at Rank 10, and so on. You might have more Drawback Levels because of grievous injuries. You can add a new Benefit or Drawback or add Levels to one you already have. As a rule, Benefits and Drawbacks should have even Levels.

# **Hollowing**

The older you are, the more Dust you‚Äôve probably Burned and when you Burn enough Dust, you start to go Hollow. Your eyes start to get hollow (some folks think this is the origin of the term), your skin gets a greenish cast. Your form becomes more shadowy, even in direct sunlight. People may hear noises around you or become on edge. If you have Hollow Influences or Glimmer Debt, you can even use them to frighten or intimidate people.

### **Hollow Influences**

For each full 100 points in your Burned total, you gain 1 point of negative Hollow Influence.

## Glimmer Debt

If you need to extract some Dust but you don‚Äôt have any XP to spend for it, there is a very dangerous way to do it: go into Glimmer Debt. Instead of spending XP, you can immediately take one or more Levels of the negative Glimmer Debt Influence to allow extracting 50 Grains / Level but this will prematurely Hollow you. It also ‚Äúeats‚Äù any XP and Grains that you would have earned until you pay it off ‚Äì keep a Grain total next to it. Every Grain you earn goes there instead of to you and every XP you earn adds 50 to the total. If you have Glimmer Debt at the new moon, you will be Visited and you might be taken.

Glimmer Debt will continue to eat your XP and Grains until the total reaches 50 for every Level of Glimmer Debt you have, at which point your debt will be removed ‚Äì note that **Glimmer Debt never partly reduces, it only disappears all at once when it‚Äôs paid back in full**. If XP cancels your Glimmer Debt with an excess of the total debt, you immediately regain the excess as Dust Grains.

## Hollow at the New Moon

If you have any Hollow Influences or Glimmer Debt, your Rank must be stronger than your Hollow and Glimmer Debt Influence Levels combined or else the Entity will try to take you: you will be Visited at midnight of the new moon. You can resist this with your Rank but your Hollow Influences and Glimmer Debt will hinder you. You can Burn Dust to aid your rolls but that will, of course, worsen your Hollowing. If you fail to resist, mark an X next to Hollow on your sheet. If you succeed and there is an X, remove it. This happens every following night for as long as there are any Xs. If you get 3 Xs, you are Taken Out and fade out of existence. You will be visited every new moon unless your Rank is stronger than the total Levels of your Hollow Influences and Glimmer Debt. For example, if you have Rank 5, 2 Levels of Hollow Influences, and Glimmer Debt \-3, you will be visited because your Rank is not stronger than the total Influence of \-5.

## The Mark of a Dust Devil

With every X you have next to Hollowing, the evidence of your Hollowing becomes drastically more pronounced. Your eyes become sunken, you prematurely age, with flesh hanging off your bones, losing hair. The noises and frightening effects become worse and worse. If you are not taken, you will slowly recover over the course of the month.
