# The Hollow World Game

**A P2P Western RPG Client**

*See [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive development guidelines*

## 📋 Component Specifications
### Named Profiles (affects storage)
- each with a different storage prefix used by the app
  - all storage uses storage prefix
- selecting a profile
  - chooses which storage profile the app uses
  - applies only to the current tab (i.e. the selection is not persisted)
  - reconnects to p2p-webapp using profile's peerID
- at startup
  - if storage exists but does not use profiles, remove it
  - if storage is empty (including if it was just removed), create the Default profile
- **Testing**: ProfileService is exposed via `window.__HOLLOW_WORLD_TEST__.profileService` in dev/test environments
  - Access profile-aware storage: `profileService.getItem(key)`
  - Get current profile: `profileService.getCurrentProfile()`
  - See [CLAUDE.md Testing section](../CLAUDE.md#test-api-for-singleton-access) for usage examples
